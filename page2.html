            <p>Have you ever received a pesky mass email that you can't figure out how to unsubscribe from? Maybe a restaurant you tried requested your email address and has bothered you since. You get so frustrated that you can't unsubscribe from their email list that you just give up. The emails continue. Sound familiar?
            </p>

            <p>
                Thatâ€™s where ProjectUnsubscribe comes in. </p>
